  <h1>OpenWARE Fetch Items Node</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The OpenWARE Fetch Items node allows you to access available items from one or more sources within an open.WARE instance. This node can be configured to retrieve data from a specified server and is useful for integrating open.WARE data into your Node-RED flows.</p>

  <h2>Node Configuration</h2>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Name:</strong> <br> The name of the node instance. This name is used to label the node within your flow.</li>
      <li><strong>Server:</strong> <br> The open.WARE server configuration from which to fetch the items. This should be configured to connect to your open.WARE instance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Input</h2>
  <p>This node accepts one input:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>A message object (<code>msg</code>) that triggers the node to fetch items from the configured open.WARE server. If <code>msg.sources</code> is provided and is a array of strings, only items belonging to the sources contained in the array will be fetched.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Output</h2>
  <p>This node produces one output:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>A message object (<code>msg</code>) containing the fetched items from the open.WARE instance. The items will be available in <code>msg.payload</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>To use the OpenWARE Fetch Items node:</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Drag and drop the node into your Node-RED workspace.</li>
      <li>Configure the node by specifying the server and a name for the node instance.</li>
      <li>Connect the node to other nodes in your flow to trigger the fetch operation and process the retrieved items.</li>
      <li>Deploy your flow. When the node receives an input message, it will fetch the items from the specified open.WARE server and pass them to the next node in the flow.</li>
  </ol>
