  <h1>OpenWARE Fetch Items Node</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The OpenWARE Fetch Items node allows you to access available items from one
    or more sources within an open.WARE instance. This node can be configured to
    retrieve data from a specified server and is useful for integrating
    open.WARE data into your Node-RED flows.
  </p>

  <h2>Node Configuration</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Name:</strong> <br />
      The name of the node instance. This name is used to label the node within
      your flow.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Server:</strong> <br />
      The open.WARE server configuration from which to fetch the items. This
      should be configured to connect to your open.WARE instance.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Input</h2>
  <p>This node accepts input:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A message object (<code>msg</code>) that triggers the node to fetch items
      from the configured open.WARE server. If <code>msg.payload</code> is a
      <code>string[]</code> or <code>msg.query.sensorInfos</code>, e.g. using
      item-multiple-select, is provided, only items belonging to the sources
      contained in the arrays will be fetched.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Output</h2>
  <p>This node produces one output:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A message object (<code>msg</code>) containing the fetched items from the
      open.WARE instance. The items will be available in
      <code>msg.payload</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>To use the OpenWARE Fetch Items node:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Drag and drop the node into your Node-RED workspace.</li>
    <li>
      Configure the node by specifying the server and a name for the node
      instance.
    </li>
    <li>
      Connect the node to other nodes in your flow to trigger the fetch
      operation and process the retrieved items.
    </li>
    <li>
      Deploy your flow. When the node receives an input message, it will fetch
      the items from the specified open.WARE server and pass them to the next
      node in the flow.
    </li>
  </ol>
